## Overview

### Screenshot

! [] (./ Screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right -click on the page and choose to "take screenshots". You can choose a full height screenshot or a cut cut based on the time of the page.If it is very long, it is best to cut it.

In addition, you can use a tool like [Fireshot] (https://getfireshot.com/) to take screenshots.Fireshot has a free option, so you do not need to buy it.

Then, cut/optimize/edit your image the way you like, add it to your project and update the file link in the image above.

** Note: Delete this notes and the above paragraphs when you add your screenshot. **
